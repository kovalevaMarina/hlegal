            An endless stream of contracts, tax issues, labor relations, corporate papers - legal work distracts you 
            from doing business. But there is not much work to do to hire an in-house lawyer.
          p.service-entry__txt.txt--white.
            In addition, over time, the work will become the same type and uninteresting for a full-time lawyer. And we 
            know very well how difficult it is to find a good candidate with experience in the field of information technology in Ukraine.
